# Coding Exercise for OpenHouse.AI

![smartmockups_lqn8lyit](https://github.com/KseGreb/React-OpenHouseAI/assets/110953599/a30cb2d2-baa1-4f5d-a7b8-d26eea042424)


## ü¶â Main information

The goal was to create a simple web application using React, Vue, or another framework that retrieves data from the provided RESTful endpoints and displays it to the user.
When creating this application, the following conditions were met:
- Present a collection of geographic communities in alphabetical order.
  Each geographic community is to be displayed with the minimum following information:
    - Community name
    - Image for the community
    - The average price of all the homes associated with that community

  ### My notes:

  1 - If given more time I would write code to validate url when there is return 400 error (currently from Rosedale neighborhood).
  
  2 - If I'd have more time I would add try-catch for the second GET call.
  
  3 - I would also try and substitute image that is not provided in API (Oakridge neighborhood) with image of Calgary skyline instead for a better user experience.
