## ü¶â Main information


The goal was to create a complete React project!

The project could have been anything: any website or an app, so I have desided to combine it together.

I used React.js to create a full website for a realtor in Calgary, AB, Canada.


## In this project you'd find:

- Navbar and React Router
- 4 working sections of the site with same design concept throughout all of the pages
- UseState and UseEffect hooks
- The use of multiple APIs
- The weather app that shows current day and temperature in Calgary
- Interactive map of Calgary
- CountUp and ScrollTrigger functionallity used for dinamically changing numbers
- Alert and Loader functionalities
- Integrated slides in one of the pages
- LocaleStorage used for making notes
- LocaleStorage used for only one alert upon loading the site
- Toggle button functionality
- Methods map(), filter(), substring() were used.
- Show More/ Show Less button
- Integrated data.js files
- Calculator functionallity with Slider component
- Chart functionallity
- Integrated Formspree for sending emails
- Adaptation for mobile devices
