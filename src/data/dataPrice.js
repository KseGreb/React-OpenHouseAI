    Alberta, in general, and Calgary, in particular, enjoy more economic freedom (and arguably more natural resources) than many other parts of Canada. As a result, Alberta offers some of the highest incomes and wages among Canadian provinces, and Calgary offers some of the highest incomes and wages among Canadian cities.

The Alberta housing market, in general, and the Calgary housing market, in particular, have avoided a housing bubble over the past few years. Thus, the Alberta housing market is far more affordable than the Ontario or British Columbia Housing market. Similarly, the Calgary housing market is far more affordable than other large Canadian housing markets, namely the Toronto housing market and the Vancouver housing market.

The strong job market and affordable housing markets resulted in interprovincial migration toward Alberta. This migration is another tailwind for the Calgary housing market. Also, note that Calgary is often called the "Energy Capital of Canada" due to its significant presence in the oil and gas industry. The performance of the energy sector has a considerable impact on the city's economy and housing market. Fluctuations in oil prices can influence housing demand and property values in Calgary.

Despite sensitivity to changes in the energy sector, which can affect job growth, migration patterns, and, subsequently, the housing market, Calgary has historically enjoyed a stable and prosperous economy due to its diverse industries, including oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, technology, and finance.`
