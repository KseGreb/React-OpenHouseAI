    Average home prices do not show the true extent of price changes because of the substitution effect. 
    When changes in home prices or mortgage rates reduce consumers' buying power, they shift their purchases to more affordable options. 
    As a result, the average price can under-represent house price inflation. 
    Moreover, luxury homes have an outsize effect on average prices, and fluctuations in the number of luxury home sales cause fluctuations in average prices.
    There is a change in the property types that Calgary buyers are interested in. 
    Over the past three years, the composition of home sales in the Calgary real estate market shifted toward condos and away from detached houses.`
